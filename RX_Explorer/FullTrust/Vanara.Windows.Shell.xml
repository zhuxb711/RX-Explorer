            The clock time by which the caller would like the binding operation to be completed. This member lets the caller limit the
            execution time of an operation when speed is of primary importance. A value of zero indicates that there is no deadline. Callers
            most often use this capability when calling the IMoniker::GetTimeOfLastChange method, though it can be usefully applied to other
            operations as well. The CreateBindCtx function initializes this field to zero.
            </para>
            <para>
            Typical deadlines allow for a few hundred milliseconds of execution. This deadline is a recommendation, not a requirement;
            however, operations that exceed their deadline by a large amount may cause delays for the end user. Each moniker implementation
            should try to complete its operation by the deadline, or fail with the error MK_E_EXCEEDEDDEADLINE.

            If a binding operation exceeds its deadline because one or more objects that it needs are not running, the moniker implementation
            should register the objects responsible in the bind context using the IBindCtxV::RegisterObjectParam. The objects should be
            registered under the parameter names "ExceededDeadline", "ExceededDeadline1", "ExceededDeadline2", and so on. If the caller later
            finds the object in the running object table, the caller can retry the binding operation.

            Typically, those implementing a new moniker class (through an implementation of IMoniker interface) call
            <c>GetRunningObjectTable</c>. It is useful to call this method in an implementation of IMoniker::BindToObject or
            IMoniker::IsRunning to check whether an object is currently running. You can also call this method in the implementation of
            IMoniker::GetTimeOfLastChange to learn when a running object was last modified.

            <para>
            Moniker implementations should call this method instead of using the <c>GetRunningObjectTable</c> function. This makes it

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Those writing a new moniker class (through an implementation of the IMoniker interface) should call this method whenever the
            implementation activates an object. This happens most often in the course of binding a moniker, but it can also happen while
            retrieving a moniker's display name, parsing a display name into a moniker, or retrieving the time that an object was last modified.
            </para>
            <para>
            <c>RegisterObjectBound</c> calls AddRef to create an additional reference to the object. You must, however, still release your
            own copy of the pointer. Calling this method twice for the same object creates two references to that object. You can release a
            reference obtained through a call to this method by calling IBindCtxV::RevokeObjectBound. All references held by the bind context
            are released when the bind context itself is released.
            </para>
            <para>
            Calling <c>RegisterObjectBound</c> to register an object with a bind context keeps the object active until the bind context is
            released. Reusing a bind context in a subsequent binding operation (either for another piece of the same composite moniker or for
            a different moniker) can make the subsequent binding operation more efficient because it doesn't have to reload that object.
            This, however, improves performance only if the subsequent binding operation requires some of the same objects as the original
            one, so you need to balance the possible performance improvement of reusing a bind context against the costs of keeping objects
            activated unnecessarily.

            IBindCtxV does not provide a method to retrieve a pointer to an object registered using <c>RegisterObjectBound</c>. Assuming the

            retrieve a pointer to the object.

            the object's moniker using the first unused key from the list: "ExceededDeadline", "ExceededDeadline1", "ExceededDeadline2", and

            request that the end user manually connect to the object, the caller can retry the binding operation after showing the moniker's
            display name. Common reasons for this error are that a password is needed or that a floppy needs to be mounted.

            This, however, improves performance only if the subsequent binding operation requires some of the same objects as the original
            one, so you need to balance the possible performance improvement of reusing a bind context against the costs of keeping objects

            In implementing a new moniker class, you call this method when an error occurs during moniker binding to inform the caller of the
            cause of the error. The key that you would obtain with a call to this method would depend on the error condition. Following is a

            <term>
            MK_E_EXCEEDEDDEADLINEâ€”If a binding operation exceeds its deadline because a given object is not running, you should register
            the object's moniker using the first unused key from the list: "ExceededDeadline", "ExceededDeadline1", "ExceededDeadline2", and
            so on. If the caller later finds the moniker in the running object table, the caller can retry the binding operation.

            <item>
            <term>
            MK_E_CONNECTMANUALLYâ€”The "ConnectManually" key indicates a moniker whose binding requires assistance from the end user. To
            request that the end user manually connect to the object, the caller can retry the binding operation after showing the moniker's
            display name. Common reasons for this error are that a password is needed or that a floppy needs to be mounted.

            identified by this moniker could not be located.) If this key is used for an OLE compound-document object, the caller can use
            IMoniker::BindToStorage to bind to the object and then try to carry out a <c>Treat As...</c> or <c>Convert To...</c> operation to
            associate the object with a different server. If this is successful, the caller can retry the binding operation.

            A bind context maintains a table of interface pointers, each associated with a string key. This enables communication between a
            moniker implementation and the caller that initiated the binding operation. One party can store an interface pointer under a
            string known to both parties so that the other party can later retrieve it from the bind context.
            </para>
            <para>
            The pointer this method retrieves must have previously been inserted into the table using the IBindCtx::RegisterObjectParam method.

            Objects using monikers to locate other objects can call this method when a binding operation fails to get specific information
            about the error that occurred. Depending on the error, it may be possible to correct the situation and retry the binding
            operation. See IBindCtx::RegisterObjectParam for more information.

            <para>
            Moniker implementations can call this method to handle situations where a caller initiates a binding operation and requests
            specific information. By convention, the implementer should use key names that begin with the string form of the CLSID of a
            moniker class. (See the StringFromCLSID function.)

            IMoniker::IsRunning to check whether an object is currently running. You can also call this method in the implementation of
            IMoniker::GetTimeOfLastChange to learn when a running object was last modified.

            Passed by callers if they want to stretch the returned image themselves. For example, if the caller passes an icon size of 80x80,
            a 96x96 thumbnail could be returned. This action can be used as a performance optimization if the caller expects that they will
            need to stretch the image.

            <summary>
            Return the item only if it is already in memory. Do not access the disk even if the item is cached. Note that this only returns
            an already-cached icon and can fall back to a per-class icon if an item has a per-instance icon that has not been cached.
            Retrieving a thumbnail, even if it is cached, always requires the disk to be accessed, so GetImage should not be called from the
            UI thread without passing MemoryOnly.

            An application must provide its AppUserModelID in the following form. It can have no more than 128 characters and cannot contain

            <para>
            CompanyName and ProductName should always be used, while the SubProduct and VersionInformation portions are optional and depend
            on the application's requirements. SubProduct allows a main application that consists of several subapplications to provide a
            separate taskbar button for each subapplication and its associated windows. VersionInformation allows two versions of an
            application to coexist while being seen as discrete entities. If an application is not intended to be used in that way, the
            VersionInformation should be omitted so that an upgraded version can use the same AppUserModelID as the version that it replaced.

            This class encapsulates the management of a message loop for an application. It supports queuing a callback to the application via
            the message loop to enable the app to return from a call and continue processing that call later. This behavior is needed when
            implementing a shell verb as verbs must not block the caller.

            IExecuteCommand::Execute() or IDropTarget::Drop() passing a method that will complete the initialization work.</note>
